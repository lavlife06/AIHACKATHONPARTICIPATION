Hackathon was all about Machine Learning and Natural Language Processsing.

We were given audio, in which conversation between call centre and the Car purchaser customer giving feedback about the car and service.

From that audio clip we have to determine that whether the customer was happy, sad, angry etc.

We used N.L.P. and Machine Learning technique to solve it.

We didn't win but i learned many things from that competition.
